### Bugs 

#### Solved Bugs

* When I put the website into a smaller screen size I realised the main body of the index page was in an order which
wasn't appealing.

* I struggled to find a way to change the order of the elements within the section.

* In the end I used Google search along with the devtools on the site to figure out that using a grid display would,
allow me to pick the exact order in which the elements would be presented.

### Validator Testing 

* HTML
    * There were no errors when checked through the official W3C validator.

* CSS
    * There were no errors when checked through the official W3C CSS validator(jigsaw).

* Accessability 
    * I ran the website through the lighthouse programme in devtools to confirm the colours and fonts I used were readable.

### Unfixed bugs
