            The Castle was built on top of its rocky peak, Castle Rock, in the heart of Edinburgh as a military fortress and royal residence.
            Home to kings and queens since the 11th century, the castle had previously been used as a military base and offered
            a vantage point for those looking to defend their domain from potential invasions and military threats.
            Once claimed and built as a site of Scottish royal sovereignty, it became central to battles and clashes
            between English and Scottish forces in the wars of Scottish Independence from the late 13th century.

            Mons Meg was once seen as cutting edge military technology. Given to King James II in 1457,
            the six-tonne siege gun could fire a 150kg gunstone for up to 3.2km (2 miles). 
            She is named after the Belgian town where she was made. When Mary Queen of Scots married in 1558,
            Mons Meg fired a gunstone over the city in celebration: it landed in what is now the Royal Botanic Garden. Her barrel finally burst in 1681.
            After 75 years in England, Mons Meg made a glorious return to the castle in 1829. Cavalry and infantry escorted her from Leith Docks to Castle Rock.
